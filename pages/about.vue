        Turner, a hobbyist DJ and audio engineer (that's me).

        I've made mixtapes my whole life, starting by recording FM radio to
        cassette in the mid 80s. In the 90s, I discovered electronic music and
        learned to dj as soon as I could get my hands on turntables. Throughout
        the 2000s, I threw a few parties around Austin with a small group of
        friends as Zoobeats Collective, and DJ'ed at events around Texas either
        under my name, or as Fracture when collaborating with long-time friend
        Cody Haynes.

        In my short trip through the DJ circuit I was honored to have opened for
        Rabbit in the Moon, Uberzone, The Crystal Method, and Adam Freeland, and
        played an afterparty for Fatboy Slim.

        In 2008, Justin Winschief (DJ SCSI) and I created Carpe Noctem, a theme
        camp and sound system that participated in Austin's regional Burning Man
        spin-off called Burning Flipside through 2011.

        Starting back in the early 2000s and until recently, I semi-regularly
        released mixtapes which throw a lasso around a variety of tempos and
        styles of breakbeat to represent my musical interests. Those mixes are
        hosted here for streaming, download, or subscription via podcast.

        My time is pretty limited these days with
        <a href="https://treyturner.info">full-time work in software testing</a>
        and being a dad, but I still try to find time to discover new music,
        experiment in the studio, and take on small audio engineering projects.
        I have particular strengths in sound effects design and podcast editing.
        If you have a project on which you'd like to collaborate, feel free to
        get in touch.
