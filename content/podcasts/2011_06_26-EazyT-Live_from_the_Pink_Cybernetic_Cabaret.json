  "description": "In late February, Carpe Noctem launched a new era of cybernetic advancement founded in the historic main hall of the Pink Palace, Austin, Texas. The project has since shut down in response to unwanted attention from various government agencies. Thankfully, audio logs were taken, and these two hours represent Eazy Tom's contribution to science that evening.",
