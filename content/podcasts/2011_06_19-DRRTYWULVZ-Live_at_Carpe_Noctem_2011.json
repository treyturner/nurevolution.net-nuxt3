  "description": "DRRTYWULVZ is a sometime solo, sometimes collaborative effort spearheaded by studio engineer and beat producer Levi Witt based out of Austin, TX. Levi is new to the podcast and Carpe Noctem, but not new to mixing or production as his considerable skill and wide but refined taste shine through in this two hour live performance recorded straight off the submixer from Thursday night of Flipside 2011. As this recording is entirely live, please forgive the occasional brief dropout. You'll find five to six gems in this mix that are original productions and will be officially presented on the forthcoming DRRTYWULVZ album.",
