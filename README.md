# nurevolution.net nuxt 3 rewrite

I've run my podcast website [nurevolution.net](https://nurevolution.net) as a Wordpress site for many years, but the theme and some of the plugins it uses (namely podpress) are no longer maintained. Wordpress was already overkill for my needs, so I started to look at alternative stacks I could use to rewrite the site and that would provide an opportunity to expand my TypeScript skills. nuxt.js seemed like a reasonable option. This repo stores the source for the redesigned site. Work is in progress as I get free time. The code is not yet deployed.
