    <p>
      nurevolution studios is a small prosumer home studio in austin, texas
      that's run by trey turner, a hobbyist dj and audio engineer (that's me).

      i've made mixtapes my whole life, starting by recording fm radio to
      cassette in the mid 80s. in the 90s, i discovered electronic music and
      learned to dj as soon as i could get my hands on turntables. throughout
      the 2000s, i threw a few parties around austin with a small group of
      friends as zoobeats collective, and dj'ed at events around texas either
      under my name, or as fracture when collaborating with long-time friend
      cody haynes.

      in my short trip through the dj circuit i was honored to have opened for
      rabbit in the moon, uberzone, the crystal method, and adam freeland, and
      played an afterparty for fatboy slim.

      in 2008, justin winschief (dj scsi) and i created carpe noctem, a theme
      camp and sound system that participated in austin's regional burning man
      spin-off called burning flipside through 2011.

      starting back in the early 2000s and until recently, i semi-regularly
      released mixtapes which throw a lasso around a variety of tempos and
      styles of breakbeat to represent my musical interests. those mixes are
      hosted here for streaming, download, or subscription via podcast.

      my time is pretty limited these days with
      <a href="https://treyturner.info">full-time work in software testing</a>
      and being a dad, but i still try to find time to discover new music,
      experiment in the studio, and take on small audio engineering projects. i
      have particular strengths in sound effects design and podcast editing. if
      you have a project on which you'd like to collaborate, feel free to get in
      touch.
